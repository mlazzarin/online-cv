career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Data Science consultant with a background in Physics.
        Delivering data-driven solutions to customers. Minimize costs, maximize results.

        Before working as a consultant I was into academic research.
        My scientific background focused on computational methods, in particular machine learning, numerical simulation and quantum computing.
        My research efforts involved machine learning applications to particle physics, novel machine learning algorithms for quantum computers, quantum simulation and GPU computing. Most of my work is public and accessible through my GitHub profile, arXiv and/or peer-reviewed journals.

        Tech skills: Python + AI/ML stuff, C/C++, CUDA & Numba/CuPy, Blender, UE 4.

        I spent my teenage years with classical music, sports, videogames and computer graphics.
        Now I'm passionate about new technologies that tackle real-world problems / contribute to the collective achievements of mankind.

experiences:
    - role: Data Scientist
      time: Since May 2022
      company: Business Integration Partners, Milan, Italy 

    - role: Quantum Software Developer
      time: October 2021 - January 2022
      company: Technology Innovation Institute, Abu Dhabi, UAE
      details: |
        As a member of the Quantum Research Center, I was one of the core developer of Qibo (https://qibo.science/), a full‑stack API for quantum simulation and quantum hardware control.
        Qibo provides tools for laboratories, a flexible API for quantum developers and a set of pre‑coded quantum algorithms for applications e.g. in chemistry or in quantum machine learning.
          - Python, C++, CUDA, Numba, CuPy.
          - Code review, documentation, version control, unit testing and continuous integration.

    - role: Research Intern
      time: November 2020 - July 2021
      company: CNR-IFN, Milan, Italy
      details: |
        I developed my Master Thesis ``Quantum machine learning by tensor networks" within the research of the CNR-IFN, as part of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence activities of the Quantum Team under the responsibility of its supervisor Prof. Enrico Prati.
        Tasks:
         - Implement classical-quantum machine learning models with open-source Python libraries e.g. TensorFlow (Quantum), Keras and Scikit-learn.
         - Reproduce results of existing literature and integrate them in custom settings. Develop novel quantum-classical algorithms.
         - Train and fine-tune machine learning models on HPC clusters.
